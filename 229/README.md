Iterative solution:
-------------------
Provides an intuitive approach to the problem.   
P(n) is found by performing a deep search over the possible segments to add to the undone polygone.
The algorithm virtually uses no memory but takes a long time to run (n=60 takes about 24h)

Recursive solution:
-------------------
Provides a faster way of computing P(n): n=60 takes about 6 minutes to run.
Algorithm is described in dynamic.pdf.
